Readme for CS5700 Project 3

Experiment Methodology:
Question to answer for experiment 1: What are the performance characteristics of Tahoe, Reno, New Reno and Vegas under different load conditions.

Test Bed: NS-2 with a possibly separate random number generator to simulate random flow pattern changes.

Create virtual network with NS2 with 4 nodes(each one running a different tcp variety: Tahoe, Reno, New Reno, Vegas) and 2 central CBR nodes.
start CBR and nodes and allow to stabilize, then start external flows based on random number generated and track when different tcp variations begin to fail.
Back off extra flows and monitor recovery of all of the nodes

Generate at least 3 iterations and compare to see the different results. This should result in 9 different data sets from 3 runs(3 sets per run per node).
Which stream do we start first, UDP to allow network to stabilize before introducing the TCP surges. Can we introduce the TCP flows first before starting UDP CBR.
Once the network is stabilized, increase CBR by 1Mbps until the performance begins to deteriorate. This rate increase may need to be more coarse depending on
performance response during the experiment. It may become necessary to increase by an order of 5 or 10 Mbps. 


Each experiment will begin with the flows initiated and allowed to run to establish their base behavior.
From there

What resources are needed to run this experiment?
- need NS 2 with TCL scripts to simulate the networks in question
- random number generator to simulate traffic flows
-
• How many resources (i.e., nodes, bandwidth, software,
etc.) are needed for this experiment?
• What parameters should be varied? What metrics
should be measured?
• How large should the experiment be? How many more
resources are needed to scale the experiment?
